          1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The first thing I noticed when interacting with the experience was the
          large imagery on the right hand side depicting MyoungAe Kim’s
          portfolio works. My eyes were immediately drawn there because of the
          sheer size of the works, and the usage of gifs and slideshow images.
          Those two aspects contrasts against the slim text and lines that
          remained static when just simply scrolling down the page.

            <li>
              Watched the first gif of ‘Advent Calendar-like Web Portfolio’ play

            <li>Scrolled up and down to view the overall experience.</li>
            <li>
              Clicked through bits and pieces of the gifs and slideshow images
              showing design work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clicked the boxes on the left-hand side because of the text saying
              “click the boxes to explore”.
            </li>
            <li>
              Moved the contents, the cakes, of the boxes around to see what
              they did. Then clicked on them rapidly because the hand wasn’t
              changing back to an arrow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Found a box that had “Merry Christmas” in it, pressed it which
              turned the website red.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flickered the colours of the website between red and white using
              “Merry Christmas”.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clicked on the top hyperlink ‘Advent Calendar-like Web Portfolio’,
              taking me to a portfolio page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Went through their separate works using the bottom left index
              page, skimming through the text and images of each one.

          3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          I spent the most time clicking through the advent calendar because it
          had multiple actions that kept me on it. The action of opening a
          Christmas calendar on a website interested me and kept me wondering
          what could possibly be in the next box. The 3D cakes, tree, and wreath
          found in the boxes had pops of green and red that went along with the
          Christmas theme, which stood out against the flat and colourless
          background. Being able to click and drag these assets kept me engaged
          because I wanted to see what they could do. Then the box with “Merry
          Christmas” in it, kept me stuck for a few seconds simply because
          flickering the website’s colour scheme was a simple and repetitive
          action that changed such a large part of the website.

          4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The most common action I took was clicking on different items; such as
          looking through the items in the advent calendar, or looking at the
          slideshow images and gifs showcasing the designer’s works.

          5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The primary goal of the interactive experience seems to be showing the
          designer’s works, and depicting their values and personal style
          through the website to appeal to potential employers. The designer,
          MyoungAe Kim, wants so stand out from the crowd to be more employable
          by showing their skillset, and therefore their value as an employee.

        <div class="dot"></div>
        <div class="question">
          6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The interactive experience is stylized to have a minimal black and
          white aesthetic throughout, which indicates Kim’s either preference or
          strengths in that style. But since it’s minimalistic, it creates more
          focus on the imagery taking up half the screen that shows off her
          works so it quickly grabs the attention of employers. The interaction
          of clicking through the advent calendar also makes the website
          interesting, showing employers that she’s creative.

          7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The experience doesn’t seem like it would be interacted with for a
          long time and seems to be a one off interaction unless being gone back
          to for inspiration by other designers; timing would be around 3
          minutes when skimming through her work descriptions and clicking
          through the advent calendar. But if someone was truly invested into
          her work because they’re thinking of hiring Kim or wants to understand
          where parts of her work are justified, they’d spend more time reading
          through paragraphs which could take around 8 minutes.

          8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The experience doesn’t have any mechanisms that would bring a user
          back regularly; it is overall a portfolio of MyoungAe Kim’s work so it
          effectively showcases different designs she has made, but other than
          the advent calendar bringing in interest for someone to take
          inspiration from, people generally wouldn’t stay or come back to the
          website.

          9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The most obvious connection is the advent calendar style interaction
          on the landing page, where boxes can be opened to discover different
          small items within them. The scrollable area showing snippets of her
          work is reminiscent of a historical timeline, where there’s a line
          that has branches extending from it to show different years and events
          indicated by the dots on the side of each title.

          10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          Creating an advent calendar through basic grids guides the user to
          click through the boxes since people generally do have personal
          experiences with advent calendars. Then mimicking a historical
          timeline encourages users to see the designer’s history of works, see
          her past works, and improvement throughout projects.

          11: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </div>

        <div class="answer">
          The minimalistic visual style is quite calming as it doesn’t have too
          much going on throughout the page. Yet overall, the simplicity of the
          website stimulates interest by creating focus through large boxy
          images of Kim’s portfolio pieces. This clear layout would make users
          feel satisfied with the interaction as it’s swift in delivering the
          necessary information of Kim’s goal, being to showcase her work.
